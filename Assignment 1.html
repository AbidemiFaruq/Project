        <h1>Starting a Narrative Essay</h2>
          <P>From the narrations disscussed so far in the two study units,it should be  clear that a narrative essay can <br> begin anywhere depending on what part of the story of the writer wishes to emphasise.</P>
         
          <p>There are three options.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You can start from the beginning of the story,as in the story of "Bimbo and the fish" on page 21</li>
                <li>You can  start from the climax of the story, as in the story of "Bisi admitted in hospital as a result <br> of an accident" on page 41</li>
                <li>You can start from the end of the  story, as in the school child's narration to his father about his <br> school day. </li>
            </ol>
          <p>Whichever you choose,make your intoduction interesting.</p>
